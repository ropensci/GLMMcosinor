## Plotting cosinor.glmm objects

The GLMMcosinor package includes two ways to visualise cosinor.glmm
objects. Firstly, the function ggplot.cosinor.glmm() creates a
time-response plot of the fitted model:

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
object <- cosinor.glmm(Y ~ X + amp_acro(time, group = "X", period = 12), data = vitamind)
autoplot(object, x_str = "X")
```

This function also allows users to superimpose the datapoints (that the
fit is based on) over the fitted model, using the
`superimpose.data = TRUE` argument:

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
object <- cosinor.glmm(Y ~ X + amp_acro(time, group = "X", period = 12), data = vitamind)
autoplot(object, x_str = "X", superimpose.data = TRUE)
```

If there are multiple factors in the model, the user can specify which
covariate to be plotted using the x_str argument which accepts a string
corresponding to a group name within the original dataset. By default,
x_str = NULL and the intercept is plotted (all group levels = 0).

The following examples demonstrate how x_str can be used to produce
different plots for the same model. Note how `predict.ribbon` can be set
to `FALSE` to remove the prediction interval from the plots.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}

testdata_two_components_mod <- testdata_two_components
testdata_two_components_mod$X <- rbinom(length(testdata_two_components$group), 2, prob = 0.5)
object <- cosinor.glmm(Y ~ group + amp_acro(times, n_components = 2, period = c(12,6), group =c("group", "X")), data = testdata_two_components_mod, family = poisson())
autoplot(object, predict.ribbon = FALSE)
```

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
object <- cosinor.glmm(Y ~ group + amp_acro(times, n_components = 2, period = c(12,6), group =c("group", "X")), data = testdata_two_components_mod, family = poisson())
autoplot(object, x_str = "X", predict.ribbon = FALSE)
```

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
object <- cosinor.glmm(Y ~ group + amp_acro(times, n_components = 2, period = c(12,6), group =c("group", "X")), data = testdata_two_components_mod, family = poisson())
autoplot(object, x_str = "group", predict.ribbon = FALSE)
```

By default, `xmin` will be set to the minimum time value in the time
vector of the original dataframe, and `xmax` will be set to the maximum
time value. If we want to focus on a specific region of the plot, we can
define use the `xlims` argument to specify the x-bounds.

For example, on the plot above, we can adjust the xlimits:

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
object <- cosinor.glmm(Y ~ group + amp_acro(times, n_components = 2, period = c(12,6), group =c("group", "X")), data = testdata_two_components_mod, family = poisson())
autoplot(object, x_str = "group", predict.ribbon = TRUE, xlims = c(13,15))
```

To increase the resolution of the plots, the `pred.length.out` can be
increased. If there are multiple periods, the function will
automatically generate an appropriate number of points to plot such that
the smallest period has sufficient resolution to appreciate cosinor
behaviour. This can be adjusted using the `points_per_min_cycle_length`
argument which is 20 by default.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
object <- cosinor.glmm(Y ~ amp_acro(times, n_components = 2, period = c(12,1000)), data = testdata_period_diff, family = poisson())

autoplot(object, points_per_min_cycle_length = 40)
```

## Polar plots

In addition to time-response plots, the GLMMcosinor package also allows
users to create polar plots. In these plots, the plotted point
represents the acrophase estimate, and the radius represents the
amplitude estimate for a given component. The ellipses represent
confidence regions.

The angle units in the plot can be specified with the `radial_units`
argument. By default, the units are in radians where a complete
revolution of the plot $(2\pi)$ represents the period for that
component. The units can be changed to degrees (where $360^\circ$
represents the period), or even to be expressed in the same units as the
period specification and time variable in the data used to fit the
model.

By default, the function creates polar plots for all components and
combines them together using the make_cowplot = TRUE argument. If the
user wishes to plot just one component, they can specify this by using
`component_index`.

The direction that the angle increases in can be changed with the
clockwise argument, and the location of the `angle = 0` starting point
can be specified with the `start` argument. Hence, if the user wishes to
create a polar plot that resembles a clock, this can be done by
specifying `clockwise = TRUE` and `start = "top"`.

The argument: `overlay_parameter_info` can be used to create a line
extending from the origin to the parameter estimate (to visualise the
amplitude estimate), and a circular arc extending from the angle
starting position (at 0) to the acrophase estimate.

The background grid can also be customised. The argument
`grid_angle_segments` is used to specify how many sectors the polar grid
has, and the 'contour_interval' argument can be used to specify the
distance between adjacent radial circles.

The argument `contour_label_frequency` determines the frequency of
contour labels. For example, setting `contour_label_frequency = 2` means
that every second contour is labelled. This is useful to avoid cluttered
labels when the contour density is high. By default,
`contour_label_frequency = 1` which means every contour is labelled.

If the user wishes to zoom into the confidence ellipses to show relevant
information, they can adjust the view from the default `full` (which
plots a full view of the polar plot) to 'zoom' (which enlarges the
smallest view window containing all confidence ellipses), or
`zoom_origin` (which enlarges the smallest view window containing all
confidence ellipses AND the origin).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
model <- cosinor.glmm(Y ~ X + amp_acro(time, group = "X", period = 12), data = vitamind)
polar_plot(model)
```

The angle units in the plot can be specified with the 'radial_units'
argument. By default, the units are in radians where a complete
revolution of the plot (2\*pi) represents the maximum period from the
model. The units can be changed to degrees, or even to be expressed in
the same units as the period specification.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
model <- cosinor.glmm(Y ~ X + amp_acro(time, group = "X", period = 12), data = vitamind)
polar_plot(model, radial_units = "degrees")
```

By default, the function creates creates polar plots for all components
and stiches them together using the make_cowplot = TRUE argument. If the
user wishes to plot just one component, they can specify this by using
'component_index', though the 'make_cowplot' argument must be FALSE for
this to register.

The direction that the angle increases in can be changed with the
clockwise argument, and the location of the angle = 0 starting point can
be specified with the 'start' argument. Hence, if the user wishes to
create a polar plot that resembles a clock, this can be done by
specifying clockwise = TRUE and start = "top".

The argument: overlay_parameter_info can be used to create a line
extending from the origin to the parameter estimate (to visualise the
amplitude estimate), and a circular arc extending from the angle
starting position (at 0) to the acrophase estimate.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
model <- cosinor.glmm(Y ~ X + amp_acro(time, group = "X", period = 12), data = vitamind)
polar_plot(model, overlay_parameter_info = TRUE)
```

The background grid can also be customised. The argument
'grid_angle_segments' is used to specify how many sectors the polar grid
has, and the 'contour_interval' argument can be used to specify the
distance between adjacent radial circles.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
model <- cosinor.glmm(Y ~ X + amp_acro(time, group = "X", period = 12), data = vitamind)
polar_plot(model, grid_angle_segments = 12, clockwise = TRUE, start = "top", contour_interval = 1)
```

If the user wishes to zoom into the confidence ellipses to show
releveant information, they can adjust the view from the default 'full'
(which plots a full view of the polar plot) to 'zoom' (which enlarges
the smallest view window containing all confidence ellipses), or
'zoom_origin' (which enlarges the smallest view window containing all
confidence ellipses AND the origin).

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
model <- cosinor.glmm(Y ~ X + amp_acro(time, group = "X", period = 12), data = vitamind)
polar_plot(model,
  grid_angle_segments = 12, clockwise = TRUE, start = "top",
  view = "zoom_origin"
)
```
