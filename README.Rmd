The goal of `{GLMMcosinor}` is to fit a cosinor model to rhythmic data with all
the flexibility and functionality of a generalized linear (mixed-) model (GLM) 
framework using `{glmmTMB}`. 

The package is also accessible via a [web app](https://aushsi.shinyapps.io/GLMMcosinor-shinyapp) 
developed using shiny.

For an introduction to the cosinor model, see the [getting started vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/GLMMcosinor/articles/GLMMcosinor.html).

Existing statistical software for circadian data analyses (including `cosinor` 
[@sachs2023cosinor] or `circacompare` [@parsons2020circacompare]) allows users 
to fit regression models to rhythmic data, but many are limited due to their 
inability to specify a link function, multiple components, or a hierarchical 
structure. `GLMMcosinor` aims to be comprehensive and flexible and is an 
improvement on other implementations of cosinor model fitting in R or Python.
See table below for features available within currently available methods.

`GLMMcosinor` makes use of the `glmmTMB` package framework for estimation of the
cosinor model. If the model has no random effects, `glmmTMB` uses 
maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the linear coefficients of the model. 
For models with random effects, a Laplace approximation is used to integrate 
over the random effects. This approximation is handled by the
[`TMB`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=TMB)
package which uses automatic differentiation of the joint likelihood function to 
efficiently compute parameter estimates. A detailed explanation of this process 
is described [here](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v070.i05) [@Kristensen2016TMB].

## Installation

You can install GLMMcosinor from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# dev version
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("ropensci/GLMMcosinor")

# or, equivalently
install.packages("GLMMcosinor", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")

# latest release version
pak::pkg_install("ropensci/GLMMcosinor@*release") 
```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(GLMMcosinor)
```


```{r}
model <- cglmm(
  vit_d ~ X + amp_acro(time, group = "X", period = 12),
  data = vitamind
)
summary(model)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
autoplot(model, superimpose.data = TRUE)
polar_plot(model)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- autoplot(model, superimpose.data = TRUE) +
  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "none")
p2 <- polar_plot(model)
cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, nrow = 1, rel_widths = c(0.4, 0.6))
```
